# FlashCards-Core

A C# .Net project that provides a basic framework to create flash cards and organize them into sets.

This is a proof of concept relying on internal storage at the moment, and hard-typed Google Cloud Api usage.
I will work to make it work depending on user-context rather than relying on a development environment.
