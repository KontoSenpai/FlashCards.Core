# FlashCards-Core

A C# .Net project that provides a basic framework to create flash cards and organize them into sets.

While trying to learn a new language, I've come to realize that online solutions for Flash Cards applications didn't suit my needs.
I decided to work on one for myself, as an opportunity to learn using the Google Cloud APIs.

This is a proof of concept relying on internal storage at the moment as this is for my personal, and hard-typed Google Cloud Api usage.

Once I reach satisfactory results with my WPF implementation, I will work to make it work depending on other environments and contexts.
